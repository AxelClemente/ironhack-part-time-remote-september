// Create two variables and assign a different number to each one. 
// Add them together and output the result to the console

// Do the same using two strings.


// Create a variable and assign a number to it. Check if the variable is less than 10 
// if it is output in the console to the userthat their variable is less than 10. 
// If not, let them know as well. 
// Confirm that both use case works by changing values

// Create an array of "pagesRead" with at least 3 values, 
// Use a for loop to make the sum of the array and return it (confirm using console.log)
// Use a conditional statement so that at the end, it prints out the average of pages read
// i.e: [10,8,21] ---> You read 13 pages on average

// Create an array "fruits" with "apple", "bananas" and "mangoes". 
// Use a for loop to print the array backwards (from the last entry to the first)
// ["apple", "bananas", "mangoes"] ---> "mangoes"
//                                      "bananas"
//                                      "apple"
